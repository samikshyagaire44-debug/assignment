            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I'm a dedicated computer science student currently pursuing my studies with a focus on full stack web development. 
                As I prepare for a career as a junior full stack developer, I'm passionate about learning and mastering both frontend 
                and backend technologies that power modern web applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                My journey in web development has been exciting and challenging. I'm particularly interested in creating responsive, 
                user-friendly interfaces while also understanding the server-side logic that makes applications functional and secure. 
                Through this course and assignment, I'm building a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks 
                that are essential in today's tech industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that full stack development offers the perfect blend of creativity and technical problem-solving. 
                My goal is to become a versatile developer who can contribute to all aspects of web application development, 
                from designing intuitive user experiences to implementing robust backend systems and database management.

            <h2>Assignment Details</h2>
            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>
                This assignment demonstrates my understanding of full stack web development concepts through the creation of 
                a comprehensive website that covers various aspects of modern web development technologies.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Assignment Requirements</h3>
            <p>
                The project includes the development of multiple interconnected web pages that explore different aspects of 
                full stack development:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Full Stack Overview:</strong> Understanding the complete web development ecosystem</li>
                <li><strong>Frontend Technologies:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap framework</li>
                <li><strong>Backend Development:</strong> Server-side programming and API development</li>
                <li><strong>Database Integration:</strong> Both SQL and NoSQL database concepts</li>
                <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Creating websites that work across all devices</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
            <p>
                Each page in this website demonstrates specific technical concepts with practical examples and code snippets. 
                The navigation system allows seamless exploration of different topics, while maintaining a consistent design 
                theme throughout the entire site.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
            <p>
